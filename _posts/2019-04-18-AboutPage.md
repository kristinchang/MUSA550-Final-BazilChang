This toolkit is part of an academic excerise for which we imagine advising Green New Deal policy makers as they work to focus funding and advocacy efforts on the regions of the country most impacted by fossil fuel production and climate change. The toolkit includes 3 pages.

**Fossil Fuel Production Dashboard**

**Air Pollution(2001-2014) Visualization**

**Senitment Analysis: #GreenNewDeal**

We illuminate the sentiments surrounding the GND to help allocate community outreach and communication resources by analyzing tweets with the hashtag #GreenNewDeal.
